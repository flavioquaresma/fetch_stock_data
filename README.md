Fetch Stock Data - Python Script for Retrieving Historical Stock Data 📈🐍

🎉 I am excited to share with you a Python script called "fetch_stock_data" that allows you to easily retrieve historical stock data using the Yahoo Finance API. This script provides a convenient way to fetch data for multiple tickers within a specified date range and save it as an Excel file. By using this script, you can streamline your stock data analysis and gain valuable insights for your investment decisions.

Features:

🔍 Fetch historical stock data for multiple tickers simultaneously.
⏰ Specify the start and end dates for the data retrieval.
💾 Save the fetched data as an Excel file for further analysis.

Instructions:

1. Install the required dependencies: yfinance and pandas. 📥

2. Import the necessary libraries: import yfinance as yf, import pandas as pd. 📚

3. Define the `fetch_stock_data` function with the following parameters:
   - tickers: a list of ticker symbols for the stocks to fetch.
   - start_date: the start date for the historical data.
   - end_date: the end date for the historical data. 📆

4. Call the `fetch_stock_data` function with the desired parameters.

5. The script will download the stock data for the specified tickers and date range, and save it as an Excel file. 💾

Example:

tickers = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "AMZN", "GOOGL", "FB"]

start_date = "2013-05-15"

end_date = "2023-05-15"

fetch_stock_data(tickers, start_date, end_date)

Note: Make sure to have the required permissions to access the Yahoo Finance API and adjust the tickers and date range according to your needs. 📝

Feel free to use this script to simplify your stock data retrieval process and enhance your investment analysis. Happy fetching! 🚀📈
